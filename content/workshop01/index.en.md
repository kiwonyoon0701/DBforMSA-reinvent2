**Welcome to Workshop1**

**You will migrate repository from Oracle to REDIS for `LIMITED OFFER`** **event**.

**You will see the new appliation with REDIS performance increase from this workshop.**

## Scenario 

```
You are a leader of developers and DBAs in a Game company. 

Your game is using Oracle RDMS for Login, Manager, Log, SHOP and Auction services including Game (World) server.
Active users/Gamers grow rapidly, and this results in overhead in Game APP Server and Game DB server.

Recently, there was a big event - LIMITED ITEM OFFER -, many gamers wanted to buy the item at the same time and it caused severe performance issue in Main Oracle.
There were lots of complaints from many users who were not able to purchase item and it should be resolved before the second event for LIMITED ITEM OFFER opens.
Your team figured out the root cause of issue with DB team that the performance issue was caused by HOT BLOCK in Oracle DB.
When accessing to the certain DB Block at the same time in RDBMS, Hot Block can be caused and this issue often happens in not only Item event in Game but also Telco billing system, Retail Order system.
Hash-partitioned reverse-index can resolve this issue but sometimes it does not work.

Having communicated with your development team and DBAs to resolve this issue, it has been decided to change the part that caused Hot Block to In-Memory DB.

# Open 4 new session in MobaXTerm

---



1. Connecting to Oracle (double click or Execute)

![image-20220207142002894](images/image-20220207142002894.png)

---

2. Open 4 new Session

![image-20220207142223185](images/image-20220207142223185.png)

---

3. Session Rename - `Oracle`,` Redis`, `APP`, `ApacheBench`

![image-20220207142438065](images/image-20220207142438065.png)

---

4. Connecting to MobaXterm, then use **Oracle** session to **execute** the following statements to initialize data in Oracle

```

5. Connecting to MobaXterm, then use **Redis** session to **execute** the following statements to initialize data in REDIS

```
ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user> redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> auth Welcome1234
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> set prod-001-quantity 3000
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get prod-001-quantity
"3000"
127.0.0.1:6379>

```

---

6. **Execute** the following commands in **APP** session in MobaXterm, to run **Legacy Flask application** using **Oracle**.

```
ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user> cd workshop03/legacy
ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user/workshop03/legacy> source bin/activate
(legacy) ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user/workshop03/legacy> flask run --host=0.0.0.0
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.

 * Running on all addresses.
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.

7. Now **Game ITEM LIMITED OFFER** event begins.  

   You are going to use **ApacheBench** Session to simulate customer requests.
   
   You are going to simluate with 150 active users to buy 3000 limited items and will check the performacne. 
   
   **Execute** the following **ab** command in **ApacheBench** session in MobaXterm
   
   **In order to process 3000 item selling, the legacy application with Oracle needed approx. 100secs.**

```
ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user> ab -c 150 -n 3000 http://10.100.1.101:5000/order

8. Go back to **APP** session in MobaXterm, then terminate **legacy application** to press **CTRL+C**. 

![image-20220308193447790](images/image-20220308193447790.png)

---

9. Now, you are going to use new application using REDIS instead of Oracle to check remaining ITEM quantity. 

   In order to do new test, need to initiailze Oracle order table. 

   **Go back to step 4** to initialize Oracle order table then **go to step 10**. 

   ---

   

10. Let's compare **legacy code to use `select for update` to check quantity** and **new code to use REDIS**. 

    Please take a look the codes. 

```
# Legacy ORDER application with Oracle
# The code includes database credential for convinience in workshop.
# In real world, it's better to use AWS Secrect Manager to protect credential. 
# You just give proper IAM role to application(EC2) and use retrieve method, without HARD-CODED credential in your application.

@app.route('/order', methods=['GET'])
def order():
    conn=cx_Oracle.connect("oshop/oshop@10.100.1.101:1521/XE")
    cursor=conn.cursor() 
    sql="select quantity from HOTDEAL_LIST where PROD_ID = 1 for update"
    output=0
    rs = cursor.execute(sql)
    for record in rs:
        currVal = record[0]
        if(currVal > 0):
            currVal = currVal - 1
            update_sql = "update HOTDEAL_LIST set quantity="+str(currVal)+" where PROD_ID=1"
            cursor.execute(update_sql)
            insert_sql = "insert into ORDER_HISTORY values (sysdate, 1,1)"
            cursor.execute(insert_sql)
            paymentProcess()
            conn.commit()

            return str(currVal)
        else:
            return "Out Of Stock"

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    return "Completed"

```

```
# New ORDER application with REDIS
# The application uses prod-001-quantity in REDIS instead of HOTDEAL_LIST table in oracle to check quantity
# The code includes database credential for convinience in workshop.
# You just give proper IAM role to application(EC2) and use retrieve method, without HARD-CODED credential in your application.

@app.route('/order-redis', methods=['GET'])
def order_redis():
    conn=cx_Oracle.connect("oshop/oshop@10.100.1.101:1521/XE")
    r = redis.Redis(host='localhost',port=6379,password='XXXXXXX')
    # You can use following statements when you want to use ElastiCache REDIS
    #r = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis-test2.h3rll4.0001.apn2.cache.amazonaws.com',port=6379,db=0)
    cursor=conn.cursor() 
    currVal = int(r.get('prod-001-quantity'))
    output=0
   # rs = cursor.execute(sql)
    print('START')
    if(currVal > 0):
        r.decr('prod-001-quantity',1)
        insert_sql = "insert into ORDER_HISTORY values (sysdate, 1,1)"
        cursor.execute(insert_sql);
        paymentProcess()
        conn.commit()

        return str(currVal)
    else:
        print("Out of Stock")
        return "Out Of Stock"

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    return "Completed"

```

11. **Execute** the following commands to run **New  application with REDIS**.

```
(legacy) ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user/workshop3/legacy>  cd ../msa/
(legacy) ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user/workshop3/msa> source bin/activate

12. Now **2nd Game ITEM LIMITED OFFER** event begins.  

    You are going to use **ApacheBench** Session to simulate customer requests.

    You are going to simluate with 150 active users to buy 3000 limited items and will check the performacne. 
    
    **Execute** the following **ab** command in **ApacheBench** session in MobaXterm
    
    **In order to process 3000 item selling, the new application with redis needed approx. 25secs.**

```
ec2-user@ip-10-100-1-101:/home/ec2-user> ab -c 150 -n 3000 http://10.100.1.101:5000/order-redis

```
As you can see the result,
the old legacy application with Oracle took 100secs, 
the new application with REDIS took 25secs. 

Performance of new application with in-memory db increased 4 times than legacy.

As you can see the code, the applicaiton code changes were very small.


```

```
% In this workshop, we are using same server for both of Oracle and REDIS to reduce cost.
% You can use standalone for DEV/Test env, it's better to use ElasiCache or MemoryDB for Redis
% to secure HA, Security, auto backup and operational excellence in Production env.
